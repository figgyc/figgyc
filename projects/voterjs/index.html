It is principally designed for competitive word games.</p><p>Written in vanilla client-side JavaScript, Voter.js is a simple web application designed primarily for the community of the word game <a href=https://discord.gg/ZWPvFRv>Ten Words of Wisdom</a> and spin-offs (although there is nothing stopping it from being used to rank any list of items). Using a simple yet sophisticated interface combined with an optimised merge sort algorithm, it allows the user to rank a list of responses to a game&rsquo;s prompt by simply clicking on which of a pair they deem superior. Especially on large sets of responses, voting of which is encouraged by hosts to improve the accuracy of results, it simplifies and accelerates the process since manually sorting a list requires you to retain a rough idea of all the responses and their positions in your memory which can be quite time consuming.</p><p>Usage exceeds 1500 users a week, and it is widely regarded as a useful tool, generally succeeding the original &ldquo;voter.exe&rdquo; project by being cross-platform and including more features such as automatic assembly of the final vote keyword (in TWOWs, responses are mapped to letters and an entire vote can be represented by a list of the characters from best to worst). It has been continuously updated with bug fixes and with additional features, such as keyboard shortcuts, grouping similar responses into tiers to save comparison time, and more.</p></content><p><a href=https://figgyc.uk/blog/active/>#active</a></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
